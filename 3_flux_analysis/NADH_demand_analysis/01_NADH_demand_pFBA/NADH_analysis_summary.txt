=== NADH/NAD+ METABOLIC ANALYSIS REPORT (pFBA VERSION) ===
Generated: 21-Oct-2025 00:43:56

ADDRESSING REVIEWER CONCERNS WITH pFBA:
1. Mass balance: All analyses maintain NAD+/NADH mass balance
2. Network-wide capacity: NAD_demand maximization with pFBA
3. Parsimonious solutions: Minimizes total flux while maintaining optimality

KEY FINDINGS (pFBA):

Model: NSD
  Max NADH oxidation capacity: 79.3677
  Biomass growth rate: 1.1544
  Mass balance check: 2.91e-06 (should be ~0)

Model: HSD
  Max NADH oxidation capacity: 58.0073
  Biomass growth rate: 0.7005
  Mass balance check: 7.15e-07 (should be ~0)

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (pFBA):
NSD: 1.000-fold change in NADH capacity
HSD: 0.731-fold change in NADH capacity
